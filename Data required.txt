Observation well water trend data/observation well trend equation
Mini watersheds dileanation data
Soil maps 
Market rates at different mandi for different crops
Area wise cropping list/Soil wise crop data/list of crops sold in a paticular market
Drip irrigation data
Yield increase due to drip
Local growth stages and crop coefficient

To determine the water trend on our own we need:
Porosity of the aqufier
Dug well depth bgl
Dug well radius	for thiem equation
Average water table level
HP of the pump inserted in the dug well 
water table rise in post monsoon period as compared to the pre-monsoon period
Pumping rate in m3
Hydraulic conductivity
Inital head conditions for inner and outer region
