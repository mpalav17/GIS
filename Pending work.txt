After konambe pilot:
Pending work

All manual data entered needs to be coming from the data base for the water balance framework
calculation. These data get stored in the database once the field worker enters it

Rainfall
input-hardcoded, refine-need to be automated(either taken from maharain or satellite)

Runoff 
Present: Calculated at a village level thus any runoff entering and exiting village is considered 0
	 Also computed using strenges table
Refine: Runoff at a mini watershed level needs to be calculated
	Newer method needs to be used

Domestic requirement: Done

Crop requirement
Present : FAO data set used for growth stages and crop coefficient and ET0 data taken is of 2002 form India
	  water portal. Near real time ET0 data formulated but not linked with the main code
Refine: Local data if present needs to be used and the crop data set needs to be expanded. Near real time ET0
	needs to be linked with the main code

Water conservation structures:
Present: Water extraction algorithm developed but not combined with the main code. Listing of conservation
	 structures done manually. The depth of the every structure is assumed and stored in the database.
	 The seepage of most of the structure is considered 50% for the entire season and number of filling to be 
	 2.
Refine: Water extraction algorithm linked with the identifying the structures through geo tagged photos of 
	JYS needs to be done. Determining seepage from the structures at a monthly basis needs to though of.

Evaporation:
Present: The evaporation amount deducted is considered to be 30% of the total surface water impounded by 
	 structures
Refine: Use the near real time data of the HMS station for better computation

Evapotranspiration
Present: Village classified into barren, forest and agri lands. The image taken is of the month of October. The
	 land under shrubs is computed manually by using the barren and agri lands data. The evaportation rate is 
	 also as per the IIT-POCRA JYS water budget assumption
Refine: The evapration rate for barren land can be taken as the one obtained from HMS station. For shrubs and forest
	land the ET0 calculated using penmann method can be used but Kc for these areas needs to be computed 
	from satellite data(if possible). The area under these lands also needs to be calculated on a monthly basis

Soil moisture
Present: Considered to be a fixed percentage of the total rainfall recieved
Refine: Needs to be computed through the soil maps and as per the formulations given by ISRO

Supply side advisories
Present: The algorithm to locate suitable sites for making strutures completed, insights on improving supply side 
	 manually listed down along with Deshpande sir
Refine: The algorihtm to locate these sites needs to be initiated. Process to automate supply side insights needs
	to be thought of

Demand side advisories
Present:
Refine:
